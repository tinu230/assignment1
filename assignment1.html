        <h1><b>HTML</b></h1>
        <p>
             The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents<br>
             designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
             It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies<br>
             such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
             Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
             HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically <br>
             and originally included cues for its appearance.
