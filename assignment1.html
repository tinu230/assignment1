        <p>
             The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents<br>
             designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
             It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies<br>
             such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
