        <h1><b>HTML</b></h1>
        <p>
             The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents<br>
             designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
             It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies<br>
             such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        <p>An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and<br>
             end of an HTML element in an HTML document. As part of an HTML element,<br>
             HTML tags help web browsers convert HTML documents into web pages.<br>
             There are four required tags in HTML. These are html, title, head and body. 
             
             Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
             HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically <br>
             and originally included cues for its appearance.
